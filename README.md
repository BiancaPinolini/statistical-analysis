# statistical-analysis
Codes for the Statistical Analysis exam in Universit√† degli Studi di Milano Bicocca.
To carry out the exercises we developed codes using Python 3.6.8 and c++, with the help of the scientific software toolkit ROOT. We used the open-source web application Jupyter Notebook and the platform to perform interactive data analysis in the CERN cloud SWAN (Service for Web based ANalysis).
