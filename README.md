# statistical-analysis
Codes for the Statistical Analysis exam in Universit√† degli Studi di Milano Bicocca.
To carry out the exercises we developed codes using \texttt{Python 3.6.8} and \texttt{c++}, with the help of the scientific software toolkit \texttt{ROOT}. We used the open-source web application \texttt{Jupyter Notebook} and the platform to perform interactive data analysis in the CERN cloud \texttt{SWAN} (Service for Web based ANalysis).
